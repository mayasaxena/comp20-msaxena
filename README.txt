1. This repository is to hold the assignments and labs I worked on in Comp 20

2. My favorite project was assignment 3 because it was interesting trying to bring in data from a different source,
and it was interesting to use the Google Maps API

3. I'm most proud of lab 6 because I added some extra things to make it look good and learned a lot doing so.

4. I've grown substantially in terms of my abilities since January. I started the semester intending to use what I
learned from this class to revamp the tae kwon do team website, and now I most certainly have the skills to do so and
more (it's going live May 18th and it looks a whole lot better). I'm hopefully going to do some web development over
the summer, and I know that what I've learned is just scratching the surface but it's good to have those skills
to use if necessary.
