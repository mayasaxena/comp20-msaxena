        <h1>Security Assessment of 2048 Game Center</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://limitless-harbor-3229.herokuapp.com/">2048 Game Center</a>
                is a web application developed by
                <a href="http://lokoyo.github.io/">Win Halelamien</a> for
                Comp 20 Assignment 4 that maintains data from the
                game <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>.
                The application offers an API for submitting a player's final
                score and grid along with a username and the time the game was finished.
                The 2048 Game Center's web interface features a scoreboard that 
                displays scores for all players sorted in descending order along
                with usernames and timestamps for each score. The web interface
                also allows users to find a player's scores and final grids by username.
        </p>

        <p>The purpose of this assessment is to identify the security vulnerabilities
                potentially present in this application, and suggest solutions to those
                problems. 
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>The application was first tested without any knowledge of the source
                code to determine obvious vulnerabilities that could be exploited
                by any attacker. Once those problems were identified, the source
                code for the project was examined to locate any other vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <p>The main security issues with this application arise from the fact
                that the data it stores and displays is not restricted or vetted
                in any way. Anyone with minimum knowledge of the application could
                store data in the application's database. That data could contain
                code runs whenever the data is loaded on a web page,
                affecting the performance of the application, and depending on
                the code that executes, damaging the user's computer.</p>

        <h2>Issues Found</h2>
        <h3>1. Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
        <h4>Location of Issue:</h4><p>2048 Game Center main page/GET API</p>
        <h4>Severity of Issue: High</h4>
        <h4>Description of Issue:</h4>
        <p>One of the major security issues with the site is the ability for an 
                attacker to inject script into the fields stored in the database.
                The data stored in the database is not sanitized in any manner before entry, it is just saved as is.
                When the application's scoreboard page loads, the saved information
                from the database is directly inserted into the HTML of the page.
                If what is stored in the database is appropriate data, there are no problems.
                However, if it is code, then the code will execute and alter the page.
                The database itself cannot be accessed in this manner, so the 
                data cannot be changed, but the site itself can be made inoperable.</p>
        <p>One effect of this vulnerability can be seen by running 
         <code>curl --data 'username=&ltiframe src="http://www.nyan.cat"&gt&lt/iframe&gt&score=0&grid={}' http://limitless-harbor-3229.herokuapp.com/submit.json</code>. This code inserts an iframe into the scoreboard. Although this does not outright prevent the application from
         functioning, it makes the insecurity of the application obvious by displaying incorrect data to all clients.</p>

                <p><img src="beforenyan.png"></p>
                <p><img src="nyancathack.png"></p>


        <p>An attacker could render the website entirely unusable by inserting 
                <code>&ltscript type="text/javascript"&gt window.location = "http://www.google.com/"; &lt/script&gt</code>
                into the username field. The script is inserted into the scoreboard page HTML by the application, and it redirects the page to Google as soon as the page loads. This obviously could be used
                in a variety of malicious manners at worst, as the page could be
                redirected anywhere, but at best it makes it impossible for a user
                to use the application for its intended purpose.
        <h4>Resolution</h4>
        <p>This issue can be resolved by sanitizing the input before it is
                inserted into the database. Characters commonly present in HTML
                can be escaped so that when the the HTML for the scoreboard loads,
                any potential malicious code will not execute, maintaining the 
                integrity of the application.</p>


        <h3>2. No Discrimination in Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h3>
        <h4>Location of Issue:</h4><p>POST API</p>
        <h4>Severity of Issue: Moderate</h4>
        <p>Although in combination with the above mentioned
                issue of non-sanitized inputs the severity could be high,
                alone, the issue is only moderate in severity as it could not
                lead to a user actively being harmed. </p>
        <h4>Description of Issue:</h4>
        <p>This application has Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled for any
                origin due to the design specification. However, this presents
                a problem as anyone could post data to the application that will then be
                stored in the database. Similarly, the data stored in the database
                can be accessed by anyone. This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker
                to entirely circumvent the purpose of the application -
                to store player's high scores from 2048. And attacker could post
                any score they wanted from anywhere because there are no restrictions on the POST request.</p>
        <h4>Resolution</h4>
                <p>Instead of allowing all origins to access the application as it is currently:
                <code>res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');</code>,
                whitelist certain origins explicitly to control the source of data.</p>

        <h3>3. Database Capacity</h3>
        <h4>Location of Issue:</h4><p>MongoDB/POST API</p>
        <h4>Severity of Issue: Moderate</h4>
        <h4>Description of Issue:</h4>
        <h4>Resolution</h4>
