Lab 5 Running Status Updates
Lab 7 Persistent Status Updates

I have an if statement in the javascript that deletes all the status updates
if you type "ANNIHILATE!!!" into the input field. That was added for fun after
I got the updating working. 

EDIT for Lab 7: The ANNIHILATE!!! feature still works - it just sets the value
of the "statuses" key to blank. The feature that restores the statuses changes
the innerHTML of the status field so it just ends up empty.

Additionally, the textbox clears after input so that it's easier to
put in more statuses.
