Lab 5 Running Status Updates

I have an if statement in the javascript that deletes all the status updates
if you type "ANNIHILATE!!!" into the input field. That was added for fun after
I got the updating working. 

Additionally, the textbox clears after input so that it's easier to
put in more statuses.

Thanks to Stack Overflow for fixing my issue with leading zeros not showing up
for minutes. Link to thread:
