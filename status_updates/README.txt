Lab 5 Running Status Updates

I have an if statement in the javascript that deletes all the status updates
if you type "ANNIHILATE!!!" into the input field. That was added for fun after
I got the updating working. 

Additionally, the textbox clears after input on click so that it's easier to
put in more statuses.
